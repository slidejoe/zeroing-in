## Recursion in decimal

In base 10, $\frac{1}{3}$ is a bit of a problem...

| 10^0 | .    | 10^-1 | **10^-2** | 10^-3 | 10^-4 | 10^-5 | 10^-6 | 10^-7 |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ---- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 0          | .          | 3          | 3    | 3             | 3              | 3                             | 3                            | 3                            |


$\frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{3}_{10} \approx 0.3333333_{10}$

<!--
As we know some fractions aren't exactly representable in decimal

- Take a third, for example
- Can take as many 10<sup>-n</sup> as you like, we'll never get to 1/3
-->

---
layout: center
---

## Recursion in binary
In base 2, $\frac{1}{3}$ is **still** problem... 

| 2^0 | .    | 2^-1 | 2^-2 | 2^-3 | 2^-4 | 2^-5 | 2^-6 | 2^-7 |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ---- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 0          | .          | 0          | 1    | 0             | 1             | 0                             | 1                            | 0                            |

$\frac{1}{3} = 0.\overline{10}_{2} \approx 0.0101010_{2} = 0.328125_{10}$

<!--
1/3 is also not representable in binary

Any number that recurs in base 10 will recur in binary
-->
---
layout: center
---

But so is  $\frac{1}{10}$... 

| 2^0  | .    | 2^-1 | 2^-2 | 2^-3 | 2^-4 | 2^-5 | 2^-6 | 2^-7 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0    | .    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 1    | 1    | 0    | 1*    |

$\frac{1}{10} = 0.0\overline{0011}_{2} \approx 0.0001100_{2} = 0.09375_{10}$

\* rounded

<!--
But in binary, 1/10 is also a recurring number
-->

---

$$
\begin{array}{c c c}
    & 0 & . & 1_{10} \\
  + & 0 & . & 2_{10} \\ \hline
    & 0 & . & 3_{10}
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c }
    & 0 & . & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1_{2} & \approx 0.1_{10}\\
  + & 0 & . & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0_{2} & \approx 0.2_{10} \\ \hline
    & 0 & . & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1_{10} & = 0.3046875_{10}
\end{array}
$$

<!-- 
And just like multiplying 0.3 recurring by 3 doesn't quite equal 1 in decimal

In binary if we add 0.1 and 0.2 we get 0.304... etc
-->

---

## Rounding errors in JavaScript

Let's see this in action!

```js {monaco-run}
console.log('ü•Å');
await new Promise(x => setTimeout(x, 1000));

console.log(0.1 + 0.2);

console.log(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1 + 0.2);
```

When we say `0.1`, remember a decimal to binary conversion (and rounding!) is happening.

The difference in answers is because we were storing our number as 8-bit (unsigned, fixed-point), but JavaScript is using `Number`, a 64-bit signed floating point number

<!--
- We can see this in JS
- running live
- remember: when we assign a decimal number in code -> translated to binary


- BTW, the reason this is different result
- we calculated an 8-bit number
- JS is using a 64-bit number

## How do you write a decimal point when you've only got 1s and 0s?!

- We've been writing fractional numbers using a `.`
- Computers store data as `0` or `1`
- `.` is not a `0` or a `1`

- Smallest precision: 0.00000000 00000001_2 &approx; 0.00002_10
- That's a lot of bits to contain a number as small as 65535_10...

</v-clicks>

<!--
- One option is fixed point notation
- Using 4 bytes
- We set a convention
  - 2 bytes before, 2 after
- Max 65,000
- Precision of 0.000 02

## Exponents, an introduction

$$c \approx 299,800,000 ms^{-1}$$
Woah, thats a big number. And its really hard to grasp the size of it at a glance.

<v-click>
So you might see this written as an exponent:

$$c \approx 2.998 \times 10^{8} ms^{-1}$$

The number is now a number between 1 and 10 (10^0 and 10^1) with an exponent to multiply it to the true value
</v-click>
<v-click>
You might also see:

$c \approx 2.998 \exp(8)ms^{-1}$
or
$c \approx 2.998e+8ms^{-1}$

Particularly on calculators.

## Exponents in binary
<v-clicks>

1. Convert to binary

  &pi; &approx; 11.001001000011111101101..._2

2. Use an exponent to make the _mantissa_ a number between 2^0 (1) and 2^1 (2)

  1.1001001000011111101101...&times;2^1_2

3. Discard the `1.` (it's always a 1)

  [1.]{v-mark.strike.orange}1001001000011111101101...&times;2^1_2

4. Add 127 to the exponent (this number is offset to allow for positive and negative exponents)

  1_2 + 01111111_2 = 10000000

4. Fill in the bits in a predefined pattern

  0 [10000000]{v-mark.box.orange=10} [1001001 00001111 1101101]{v-mark.circle.orange=11}

## .NET's `decimal`

A way of representing base 10/decimal numbers accurately in binary.

- Decimal integers are always exactly representable as binary integers
- `decimal`s store an integer value and a (negative) base 10 exponent
- e.g. [31415926535897932384626433833]{v-mark.box.orange=2}&times;[10]{v-mark.underline.orange=1}<sup>- [28]{v-mark.circle.orange=3}</sup><sub>10</sub> []{v-click}
- 0 [11001011...00101001]{v-mark.box.orange=2} [11100]{v-mark.circle.orange=3} []{v-click}[]{v-click}

<v-clicks>

- Loads of bytes
  - 16 bytes (twice the size of a double), only uses 102 bits
- 28-29 digits of precision
- Use when precision matters, e.g. money
- Speaking of money, `decimal`s come at a cost (a performance one)
- Bad luck if you're using JavaScript

var myHalf = (Half)3.14; // .NET 5+

## Don't need negative numbers or fractions?

Try unsigned-integers to store numbers over twice as large ($n\times2+1$) as their signed counterparts!
```cs
ushort unsignedShort = 65535;
uint unsignedInt = 4294967295;
ulong unsignedLong = 18446744073709551615;
```
